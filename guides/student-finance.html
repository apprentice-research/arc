        <h2>Why This Guide Exists</h2>
<p>Student finance in the UK is confusing enough when you've taken the standard school-to-university route. When you're coming from an apprenticeship — possibly with existing qualifications, possibly over 25, possibly already holding a degree — the rules get considerably more complicated.
</p>
<p>Misinformation is rampant. People will tell you that you "can't get funding for a second degree" (not always true), that "mature students don't get maintenance loans" (wrong), or that a PhD will cost you tens of thousands of pounds (almost never the case in science). This guide cuts through the noise.
</p>
<p>A caveat: student finance rules change regularly, and they differ between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This guide covers the main principles as of 2025–26. Always check the current details with your regional student finance body before making decisions.
</p>
<h2>The Basics: How UK Student Finance Works</h2>
<p>For first-time undergraduate students in England, the system has two main components:
</p>
<p>A <strong>tuition fee loan</strong> — paid directly to the university, covering the cost of the course (up to £9,790 per year for 2026–27 entry).
</p>
<p>A <strong>maintenance loan</strong> — paid to you, to help with living costs. The amount depends on your household income and whether you live at home, away from home, or in London. The maximum for students living away from home outside London is currently around £10,000–£14,000 per year depending on circumstances.
</p>
<p>Both are repaid after graduation, but only when you earn above the threshold (currently £25,000 for Plan 5 loans). Repayments are a percentage of your income above that threshold — not related to the total amount you owe. Unpaid balances are written off after 40 years. It's more like a graduate tax than a traditional debt.
</p>
<h2>If You're Over 25 (The Mature Student Rules)</h2>
<p>For student finance purposes, "mature student" means over 25. The main practical difference is that your maintenance loan assessment is based on your own income rather than your parents' household income. This often works in your favour — if you've been earning an apprentice or early-career salary, your income is likely lower than the parental household income threshold, which means you may receive a higher maintenance loan.
</p>
<p>You're still eligible for both tuition fee and maintenance loans for your first undergraduate degree, regardless of your age. There is no upper age limit for student finance in the UK.
</p>
<h2>If You Already Have a Qualification (The ELQ Rule)</h2>
<p>This is the big one for many apprentices, and it's where confusion runs rampant.
</p>
<p>The Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) rule says that if you already hold a degree-level qualification (Level 6 — a bachelor's degree), you generally cannot get student finance for another qualification at the same or lower level.
</p>
<p>What this means in practice: if you completed a degree apprenticeship and hold a BSc, you typically cannot get a tuition fee loan for a second bachelor's degree.
</p>
<p>However, there are important exceptions. You can still get funding if you're studying certain shortage subjects — nursing, midwifery, and allied health professions (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, radiography, etc.) are exempt from the ELQ rule. You can get funding if you previously started but didn't complete a degree — the rules on "gift years" and interrupted study mean you may retain eligibility. And crucially, the ELQ rule does not apply to postgraduate study. If you're going from a bachelor's to a master's or PhD, different funding streams apply entirely.
</p>
<p><strong>From 2026–27</strong>, the Lifelong Learning Entitlement (LLE) is being introduced, which will give everyone funding equivalent to four years of full-time undergraduate study across their lifetime. Under the LLE, if your first degree took three years, you would have one year of entitlement remaining for further study. This is a significant change, and the details are still being finalised — check GOV.UK for the latest.
</p>
<h2>If You Have a Foundation Degree, HND, or HNC (Topping Up)</h2>
<p>If your apprenticeship gave you a Level 4 or Level 5 qualification (HNC, HND, or foundation degree) rather than a full bachelor's, you can get student finance to "top up" to a full honours degree. This typically takes one year full-time or two years part-time.
</p>
<p>You are eligible for both a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan for the top-up year, even though you already have a Level 4/5 qualification. This is because you're progressing to a higher level, not repeating one.
</p>
<h2>Funding a Master's</h2>
<p>Postgraduate master's loans are available to UK residents regardless of what undergraduate qualification they already hold. The loan is currently up to £12,471 for the full course (not per year) and is paid to you, not the university — so you manage the allocation between fees and living costs yourself.
</p>
<p>The catch: this often doesn't cover the full cost. Master's tuition fees in science subjects range from around £10,000 to £15,000 or more, and you still need to live. The shortfall needs to come from savings, part-time work, employer contributions, or scholarships and bursaries.
</p>
<p>Some master's programmes offer their own funding — check the university department's website. The Alternative Guide to Postgraduate Funding (available online and in university libraries) lists charity and trust funders that support postgraduate study. Some professional bodies also offer bursaries.
</p>
<p>If you're considering a 1+3 integrated programme (a funded master's year followed by a PhD), the entire thing is typically covered by the doctoral funding — meaning you don't need a separate master's loan.
</p>
<h2>Funding a PhD</h2>
<p>This is where the picture brightens considerably. Most science PhDs in the UK are fully funded, meaning your tuition fees are paid and you receive a tax-free stipend to cover living costs. You do not need to take out a loan.
</p>
<p>The standard UKRI stipend for 2025–26 is £20,780 per year (£22,780 in London), and it is not means-tested and not repayable. It's a living allowance, not a loan. Some funders (charities, industry partners) offer higher stipends.
</p>
<p>A Doctoral Loan also exists (up to £28,673 over the full programme), but this is mainly for self-funded PhDs, which are uncommon in science. If you have a fully funded studentship, you don't need the doctoral loan.
</p>
<p>For a full breakdown, see our PhD Funding Guide.
</p>
<h2>Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)</h2>
<p>If you have a disability, long-term health condition, mental health condition, or specific learning difficulty (such as dyslexia), you may be eligible for the Disabled Students' Allowance. This provides extra funding for things like specialist equipment, support workers, and travel costs related to your condition.
</p>
<p>DSA is available for undergraduate and postgraduate study, and it does not need to be repaid. Apply through your regional student finance body. You'll need evidence of your condition, which can come from a medical professional, educational psychologist, or other appropriate assessor.
</p>
<h2>Other Funding Sources Worth Knowing About</h2>
<p><strong>NHS Learning Support Fund</strong> — If you're studying nursing, midwifery, or an allied health profession, you may be eligible for a training grant (currently at least £5,000 per year), plus additional support for childcare, travel, and dual accommodation.
</p>
<p><strong>University hardship funds</strong> — Most universities have discretionary funds for students in financial difficulty. These are underused because people don't know about them. Ask student services.
</p>
<p><strong>Employer sponsorship</strong> — If you're staying with your employer while studying part-time, they may contribute to fees or provide study leave. It's always worth asking.
</p>
<p><strong>Charitable trusts and foundations</strong> — Hundreds of small trusts offer grants for education. The Alternative Guide to Postgraduate Funding and Turn2us are good starting points.
</p>
<p><strong>Devolved nations</strong> — If you're a resident of Scotland (SAAS), Wales (Student Finance Wales), or Northern Ireland (Student Finance NI), the rules and amounts differ. Always check with your regional body.
</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Don't let assumptions about cost prevent you from exploring your options. PhD funding in science is almost always available. Undergraduate and postgraduate finance is more accessible than most people realise. And the rules for non-standard applicants, while complicated, are navigable if you know where to look.
</p>
<p>The single most important thing you can do is contact the student finance team at the university you're interested in. Explain your situation — your qualifications, your age, your employment history — and ask what you're eligible for. They deal with non-standard applicants every day, and they can give you specific, personalised guidance.
</p>
<p>Don't guess. Ask.
